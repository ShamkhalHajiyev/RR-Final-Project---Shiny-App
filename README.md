# Visalization of COVID-19 in Shiny - APP

At the latest since the COVID-19 is a pandemic, half of the world is paying attention to the case statistics.  We decided to create a shiny app which will visualize the data set in various types. 

In app, we will have 4 main tabs, Graphs, Compare the datas of Countries, Data Review, and About Project. We will give a lot of options to user to select the visaluzation type based on his requirements. 

The data is taken from the folder which contains daily time series summary tables, including confirmed, deaths and recovered. All data is read in from the daily case report. The time series tables are subject to be updated if inaccuracies are identified in our historical data. The daily reports will not be adjusted in these instances to maintain a record of raw data.

Below you can find the dataset of our project:
